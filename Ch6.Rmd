# *Ex.1* {#ex1} 

We perform best subset, forward stepwise, and backward stepwise
selection on a single data set. For each approach, we obtain p + 1
models, containing 0, 1, 2, . . . , p predictors. Explain your answers:

*(a)* Which of the three models with k predictors has the smallest
training RSS?
