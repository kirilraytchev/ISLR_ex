# *Ex.1* {#ex1} 

We perform best subset, forward stepwise, and backward stepwise
selection on a single data set. For each approach, we obtain p + 1
models, containing 0, 1, 2, . . . , p predictors. Explain your answers:

*(a)* Which of the three models with k predictors has the smallest
training RSS?

>**Answer:** Best subset. It tries all possible combinations and the one with the smallest training RSS can be selected.

*(b)* Which of the three models with k predictors has the smallest
test RSS?

>**Answer:** Best subset has the highest chance of having the smallest test RSS as it has the smallest training RSS.

*(c)* True or False:

*i.* The predictors in the k-variable model identified by forward
stepwise are a subset of the predictors in the (k+1)-variable
model identified by forward stepwise selection.

>**Answer:** True

*ii.* The predictors in the k-variable model identified by backward
stepwise are a subset of the predictors in the (k + 1)-
variable model identified by backward stepwise selection.

>**Answer:** True

*iii.* The predictors in the k-variable model identified by backward
stepwise are a subset of the predictors in the (k + 1)-
variable model identified by forward stepwise selection.

>**Answer:** False

*iv.* The predictors in the k-variable model identified by forward
stepwise are a subset of the predictors in the (k+1)-variable
model identified by backward stepwise selection.

>**Answer:** False

*v.* The predictors in the k-variable model identified by best
subset are a subset of the predictors in the (k + 1)-variable
model identified by best subset selection.

>**Answer:** False

# *Ex.2* {#ex2}

For parts (a) through (c), indicate which of i. through iv. is correct.
Justify your answer.

*(a)* The lasso, relative to least squares, is:

*i.* More flexible and hence will give improved prediction accuracy
when its increase in bias is less than its decrease in
variance.

>**Answer:** Lasso is less flexible due to the inserted $\lambda$ "noise". That helps prevent overfitting.

*ii.* More flexible and hence will give improved prediction accuracy
when its increase in variance is less than its decrease
in bias.

>**Answer:** The same as *i.*

*iii.* Less flexible and hence will give improved prediction accuracy
when its increase in bias is less than its decrease in
variance.

>**Answer:** The Lasso is better when it decreases variance more than increasing bias.

*iv.* Less flexible and hence will give improved prediction accuracy
when its increase in variance is less than its decrease
in bias.

>**Answer:** That is the opposite of *iii.*, hence not correct

*(b)* Repeat *(a)* for ridge regression relative to least squares.

>**Answer:** The same as *(a)*

*(c)* Repeat *(a)* for non-linear methods relative to least squares.

>**Answer:** Non-linear methods are more flexible and will give improved prediction accuracy when variance increases less than bias decreases, hence *ii.* in correct.

# *Ex.3* {#ex3}

Suppose we estimate the regression coefficients in a linear regression
model by minimizing

`r knitr::include_graphics("Ch6Ex3.jpg")`

for a particular value of $s$. For parts *(a)* through *(e)*, indicate which
of *i.* through *v.* is correct. Justify your answer.

*(a)* As we increase $s$ from 0, the training RSS will:

>**Answer:** Training RSS will steadily decrease, hence *iv.* is correct

*(b)* Repeat *(a)* for test RSS.

>**Answer:** Test RSS will decrease initially, since increase of variance will be hindered, but then eventually will start increasing, hence *ii.* is correct

*(c)* Repeat *(a)* for variance.

>**Answer** Variance will steadily increase, hence *iii.* is correct

*(d)* Repeat *(a)* for (squared) bias.

>**Answer:** Bias will steadily decrease, hence *iv.* is correct

*(e)* Repeat *(a)* for the irreducible error.

>**Answer:** *v.* is correct - remain constant

# *Ex.4* {#ex4}

Suppose we estimate the regression coefficients in a linear regression
model by minimizing

`r knitr::include_graphics("Ch6Ex4.jpg")`

for a particular value of $\lambda$. For parts *(a)* through *(e)*, indicate which
of *i.* through *v.* is correct. Justify your answer.

*(a)* As we increase $\lambda$ from 0, the training RSS will:

>**Answer:** Training RSS will steadily increase - *iii.*. $\beta$ values will be becoming smaller and smaller, hence train RSS will be increasing

*(b)* Repeat *(a)* for test RSS.

>**Answer:** *(ii.)* is correct - decrease initially, and than eventually start increasing in a U-shape. Decrease at first stage is due to the fact that overfitting is being prevented from the $\lambda$ increase. Increase at the last stage is due to the fact that too high $\lambda$ values cause the model to start deviating substantially 

*(c)*  Repeat *(a)* for variance.

>**Answer:** *(iv.)* is correct - steadily decrease. Increasing $\lambda$ causes the model to become less and less flexible, hence the variance decrease

*(d)* Repeat *(a)* for (squared) bias.

>**Answer:** *(iii.)* is correct - steadily increase. With the decrease of flexibility comes the increase of bias. 

*(e)* Repeat *(a)* for the irreducible error.

>**Answer:** *(v.)* is correct - remain constant. This is by definition.

# *Ex.5* {#ex5}

It is well-known that ridge regression tends to give similar coefficient
values to correlated variables, whereas the lasso may give quite different
coefficient values to correlated variables. We will now explore
this property in a very simple setting.

Suppose that $n = 2$, $p = 2$, $x_{11} = x_{12}$, $x_{21} = x_{22}$. Furthermore,
suppose that $y_1+y_2 = 0$ and $x_{11}+x_{21} = 0$ and $x_{12}+x_{22} = 0$, so that
the estimate for the intercept in a least squares, ridge regression, or
lasso model is zero: $\hat\beta_0 = 0$.

*(a)* Write out the ridge regression optimization problem in this setting.

>**Answer:** We have to minimize the following:

`r knitr::include_graphics("Ch6Ex5_a.jpg")`

*(b)* Argue that in this setting, the ridge coefficient estimates satisfy $\hat\beta_1 = \hat\beta_2$

>**Answer:** To find the coeff. we have to differentiate by $\beta_1$ and $\beta_2$ and solve for $0$

`r knitr::include_graphics("Ch6Ex5_b.jpg")`

*(c)* Write out the lasso optimization problem in this setting.

*(d)* Argue that in this setting, the lasso coefficients $\hat\beta_1$ and $\hat\beta_2$ are
not uniqueâ€”in other words, there are many possible solutions
to the optimization problem in (c). Describe these solutions.

>**Answer (c)&(d):** We get $\beta_1$ dependent on $\beta_2$, so we do not have a closed solution

`r knitr::include_graphics("Ch6Ex5_c_d.jpg")`

# *Ex.6* {#ex6}

We will now explore (6.12) and (6.13) further.

*(a)* Consider (6.12) with p = 1. For some choice of $y_1$ and $\lambda > 0$,
plot (6.12) as a function of $\beta_1$. Your plot should confirm that
(6.12) is solved by (6.14).

>**Answer:** Following is the plot and the confirmation:

```{r}
beta1 <- seq(from = 1, to = 5, by = 0.1)
y <- 3
lambda <- 0.5

fbeta1_reg_6a <- function(beta1, y, lambda){
        
        fbeta1 <- (y - beta1)^2 + lambda*beta1^2
        fbeta1
}

fbeta1 <- map_dbl(beta1, fbeta1_reg_6a, y, lambda)

beta1formula_6a <- y / (1 + lambda)

ggplot() +
        geom_line(aes(y = fbeta1, x = beta1), color = "blue") + 
        geom_hline(aes(yintercept = y), color = "red") +
        geom_vline(aes(xintercept = beta1formula_6a), color = "green")
```

*(b)* Consider (6.13) with p = 1. For some choice of $y_1$ and $\lambda > 0$,
plot (6.13) as a function of $\beta_1$. Your plot should confirm that
(6.13) is solved by (6.15).

>**Answer:** Following is the plot and the confirmation:

```{r}
beta1 <- seq(from = 1, to = 5, by = 0.1)
y <- 3
lambda <- 0.5

fbeta1_reg_6b <- function(beta1, y, lambda){
        
        fbeta1 <- (y - beta1)^2 + lambda*beta1
        fbeta1
}

fbeta1 <- map_dbl(beta1, fbeta1_reg_6b, y, lambda)

beta1formula_6b <- y - lambda/2 ## y > lambda/2

ggplot() +
        geom_line(aes(y = fbeta1, x = beta1), color = "blue") + 
        geom_hline(aes(yintercept = y), color = "red") +
        geom_vline(aes(xintercept = beta1formula_6b), color = "green")
```

# *Ex.7* {#ex7}

We will now derive the Bayesian connection to the lasso and ridge
regression discussed in Section 6.2.2.

*(a)* Suppose that $y_i = \beta_0 + \sum_{j=1}^px_{ij}\beta_j + \epsilon_i$ where $\epsilon_1, ...., \epsilon_n$ are independent and identically distributed from a $N(0, \sigma^2)$ distribution.
Write out the likelihood for the data.

>**Answer:** Following is the likelihood:

`r knitr::include_graphics("Ch6Ex7_a.jpg")`

*(b)* Assume the following prior for $\beta: \beta_1, . . . , \beta_p$ are independent
and identically distributed according to a double-exponential distribution with mean 0 and common scale parameter b: i.e.$p(\beta) = \frac{1}{2b}exp(\frac{-\lvert\beta\rvert}{b})$. Write out the posterior for $\beta$ in this setting.

>**Answer:** Following is the posterior:

`r knitr::include_graphics("Ch6Ex7_b.jpg")`

*(c)* Argue that the lasso estimate is the $mode$ for $\beta$ under this posterior
distribution.

>**Answer:** Following is the way to argue:

`r knitr::include_graphics("Ch6Ex7_c.jpg")`

*(d)* Now assume the following prior for $\beta: \beta_1,....,\beta_p$ are independent
and identically distributed according to a normal distribution with mean zero and variance $c$. Write out the posterior for $\beta$ in this setting.

>**Answer:** Following is the posterior:

`r knitr::include_graphics("Ch6Ex7_d.jpg")`

*(e)* Argue that the ridge regression estimate is both the mode and
the mean for $\beta$ under this posterior distribution.

>**Answer:** Following is the way to argue:

# *Ex.8* {#ex8}

In this exercise, we will generate simulated data, and will then use
this data to perform best subset selection.

*(a)* Use the `rnorm()` function to generate a predictor $X$ of length
$n = 100$, as well as a noise vector $\epsilon$ of length $n = 100$.

>**Answer** Following are the vectors:

```{r}
set.seed(123) 
x <- rnorm(100)
set.seed(321)
eps <- rnorm(100)
```

*(b)* Generate a response vector $Y$ of length $n = 100$ according to
the model 

$Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1X + \beta_2X^2 + \beta_3X^3 + \epsilon$

where $\beta_0, \beta_1, \beta_2, \beta_3$ are constants of your choice.

>**Answer:** Following is the response vector:

```{r}
beta_0 <- 0.5
beta_1 <- 3
beta_2 <- 1.2
beta_3 <- -0.123

y <- beta_0 + beta_1*x + beta_2*x^2 + beta_3*x^3 + eps

tbl_data <- tibble(
  x,
  y
)

tbl_data
```

*(c)* Use the `regsubsets()` function to perform best subset selection
in order to choose the best model containing the predictors
$X, X^2,...., X^{10}$.

What is the best model obtained according to
$C_p$, $BIC$, and adjusted $R^2$?

Show some plots to provide evidence
for your answer, and report the coefficients of the best model obtained.

*Note* you will need to use the `data.frame()` function to
create a single data set containing both $X$ and $Y$.

>**Answer:** We start with performing best subset selection, next we select the best model obtained  

* performing best subset selection

```{r}
n <- 10
mod_form <- as.formula(y ~ poly(x, n, raw = T))

bestsel <- regsubsets(mod_form, tbl_data, nvmax = 10)

tbestsel <- tidy.regsubsets(bestsel) %>%
  mutate(model.number = 1:n()) %>%
  select(model.number, everything())

tbestsel
```

* selecting the best model

```{r}
gg.adj.r <- ggplot(data = tbestsel, aes(y = adj.r.squared, x = model.number)) + 
  geom_point(color = "red", size = 3) +
  geom_line() +
  scale_x_discrete(limits = c(1:nrow(tbestsel))) +
  xlab("model number")

gg.cp <- ggplot(data = tbestsel, aes(y = mallows_cp, x = model.number)) + 
  geom_point(color = "blue", size = 3) +
  geom_line() +
  scale_x_discrete(limits = c(1:nrow(tbestsel))) +
  xlab("model number")

gg.bic <- ggplot(data = tbestsel, aes(y = BIC, x = model.number)) + 
  geom_point(color = "green", size = 3) +
  geom_line() +
  scale_x_discrete(limits = c(1:nrow(tbestsel))) +
  xlab("model number")


grid.arrange(gg.adj.r, gg.cp, gg.bic, ncol = 1)
```

Model #2 exhibits most optimum characteristics.

* the coefficients of the best model obtained are:

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
coef(bestsel, 2) %>% broom::tidy()
```


*(d)* Repeat *(c)*, using forward stepwise selection and also using backwards
stepwise selection. How does your answer compare to the
results in *(c)*?

>**Answer:** First we do forward and then backwards.

* forward stepwise selection

```{r}
forstepsel <- 
  regsubsets(mod_form, tbl_data, nvmax = 19, method = "forward")
  
tforstepsel <-  
  forstepsel %>%
  tidy %>%
  mutate(model.number = 1:n()) %>%
  select(model.number, everything())

tforstepsel
```

```{r}
gg.adj.r <- ggplot(data = tforstepsel, aes(y = adj.r.squared, x = model.number)) + 
  geom_point(color = "red", size = 3) +
  geom_line() +
  scale_x_discrete(limits = c(1:nrow(tforstepsel))) +
  xlab("model number")

gg.cp <- ggplot(data = tforstepsel, aes(y = mallows_cp, x = model.number)) + 
  geom_point(color = "blue", size = 3) +
  geom_line() +
  scale_x_discrete(limits = c(1:nrow(tforstepsel))) +
  xlab("model number")

gg.bic <- ggplot(data = tforstepsel, aes(y = BIC, x = model.number)) + 
  geom_point(color = "green", size = 3) +
  geom_line() +
  scale_x_discrete(limits = c(1:nrow(tforstepsel))) +
  xlab("model number")


grid.arrange(gg.adj.r, gg.cp, gg.bic, ncol = 1)
```

`Model #2` exhibits most optimum characteristics and is the same choice as from best subset method

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
coef(forstepsel, 2) %>% broom::tidy()
```

* backwards stepwise selection

```{r}
backstepsel <- 
  regsubsets(mod_form, tbl_data, nvmax = 19, method = "backward")
  
tbackstepsel <-  
  backstepsel %>%
  tidy %>%
  mutate(model.number = 1:n()) %>%
  select(model.number, everything())

tbackstepsel
```

```{r}
gg.adj.r <- ggplot(data = tbackstepsel, aes(y = adj.r.squared, x = model.number)) + 
  geom_point(color = "red", size = 3) +
  geom_line() +
  scale_x_discrete(limits = c(1:nrow(tbackstepsel))) +
  xlab("model number")

gg.cp <- ggplot(data = tbackstepsel, aes(y = mallows_cp, x = model.number)) + 
  geom_point(color = "blue", size = 3) +
  geom_line() +
  scale_x_discrete(limits = c(1:nrow(tbackstepsel))) +
  xlab("model number")

gg.bic <- ggplot(data = tbackstepsel, aes(y = BIC, x = model.number)) + 
  geom_point(color = "green", size = 3) +
  geom_line() +
  scale_x_discrete(limits = c(1:nrow(tbackstepsel))) +
  xlab("model number")


grid.arrange(gg.adj.r, gg.cp, gg.bic, ncol = 1)

```

Model #3 exhibits most optimum characteristics with this method

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
coef(forstepsel, 3) %>% broom::tidy()
```

*(e)* Now fit a lasso model to the simulated data, again using $X, X^2,..., X^10$ as predictors. Use cross-validation to select the optimal value of $\lambda$. Create plots of the cross-validation error as a function of $\lambda$. Report the resulting coefficient estimates, and discuss the
results obtained.

>**Answer** First we fit a lassso model and select optimal $\lambda$, them we create plots and last we report and discuss

* fit a lasso and select optimal $\lambda$

```{r}
# Find the best lambda using cross-validation
x <- model.matrix(mod_form, tbl_data)[,-1]
y <- tbl_data$y

cv <- cv.glmnet(x, y, alpha = 0)
# Display the best lambda value
cv$lambda.min
```

* cv error = f($\lambda$)

```{r}
plot(cv)
```

* the resulting coef. estimates

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Fit the final model on the training data
model <- glmnet(x, y, alpha = 1, lambda = cv$lambda.min)

# Dsiplay regression coefficients
coef(model) %>% tidy
```


So, we have non-zero coef. for $X$ and $X^2$.

*(f)* Now generate a response vector $Y$ according to the model

$Y = \beta_0 + \beta_7X^7 + \epsilon$

and perform best subset selection and the lasso. Discuss the
results obtained.

>**Answer:** First we generate, then we perform best subset, after that we perform the lasso and lastly we discuss the results obtained.

* generating $Y$

```{r}
set.seed(123) 
x <- rnorm(100)
set.seed(321) 
eps <- rnorm(100)

beta_0 <- 0.123
beta_7 <- 1.4

y <- beta_0 + beta_7*x^7 + eps

tbl_data <- tibble(
  x,
  y
)

tbl_data
```

* best subset

```{r}
n <- 10
mod_form <- 
  as.formula(y ~ poly(x, n, raw = T))

bestsel <- 
  regsubsets(mod_form, tbl_data)

tbestsel <- 
  tidy.regsubsets(bestsel) %>%
  mutate(model.number = 1:n()) %>%
  select(model.number, everything())

tbestsel
```

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
gg.adj.r <- ggplot(data = tbestsel, aes(y = adj.r.squared, x = model.number)) + 
  geom_point(color = "red", size = 3) +
  geom_line() +
  scale_x_discrete(limits = c(1:nrow(tbestsel))) +
  xlab("model number")

gg.cp <- ggplot(data = tbestsel, aes(y = mallows_cp, x = model.number)) + 
  geom_point(color = "blue", size = 3) +
  geom_line() +
  scale_x_discrete(limits = c(1:nrow(tbestsel))) +
  xlab("model number")

gg.bic <- ggplot(data = tbestsel, aes(y = BIC, x = model.number)) + 
  geom_point(color = "green", size = 3) +
  geom_line() +
  scale_x_discrete(limits = c(1:nrow(tbestsel))) +
  xlab("model number")


grid.arrange(gg.adj.r, gg.cp, gg.bic, ncol = 1)
```

We observe that `model.number #2` exhibits highest adj. $R^2$ and lowest $C_p$, though $BIC$ is not the min.

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
coef(bestsel, 2) %>% tidy()
```


* lasso

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Find the best lambda using cross-validation
x <- model.matrix(mod_form, tbl_data)[,-1]
y <- tbl_data$y

cv <- cv.glmnet(x, y, alpha = 0)
# Display the best lambda value
#cv$lambda.min

# Fit the final model on the training data
model <- glmnet(x, y, alpha = 1, lambda = cv$lambda.min)

# Dsiplay regression coefficients
coef(model) %>% tidy()
```

* Conclusion: lasso zero-ed feature $X^3$ otherwise present in best subset.

```

* coef are

```

* the value of M

```

From $M = 5$ onwards RMSE decreases slightly, so we can assume a value of $6$

* the test error

pcr_pred <- predict(pcr_fit, COllege_test, ncomp = 6)
mse_9e <- mean((pcr_pred - y_test)^2)

```

Report the test error obtained, along with the value
of M selected by cross-validation.

>**Answer:** FOllowing is the PLS fit, then the value of M, and finally the test error

```{r}

summary(plsr_fit)
```

```{r}
validationplot(plsr_fit, val.type="MSEP")
```

From $M = 5$ onwards RMSE decreases slightly, so we can assume a value of $6$

* the test error

```{r}
plsr_pred <- predict(plsr_fit, COllege_test, ncomp = 6)
mse_9f <- mean((plsr_pred - y_test)^2)

tbl_ex9 <- 
  tbl_ex9 %>% add_row(
  model = as_factor("pls"),
  mse = mse_9f
)

format(mse_9f, big.mark = " ")
```

*(g)* Comment on the results obtained. How accurately can we predict
the number of college applications received? Is there much
difference among the test errors resulting from these five approaches?

>**Answer:** Following is the comparison

```{r}
ggplot(data = tbl_ex9) +
  geom_line(aes(x = reorder(model, mse), y = mse, group = 1)) +
  geom_point(aes(x = reorder(model, mse), y = mse, shape = model, color = model), size = 3) +
  xlab("model")
```

Lasso model exhibits the lowest mse and PCR the highest.

# *Ex.10* {#ex10}

We have seen that as the number of features used in a model increases,
the training error will necessarily decrease, but the test error may not.
We will now explore this in a simulated data set.

*(a)* Generate a data set with $p = 20$ features, $n = 1,000$ observations,
and an associated quantitative response vector generated
according to the model

$Y = X\beta + \epsilon$

where $\beta$ has some elements that are exactly equal to zero.

>**Answer:** Following is the generation of the data set

```{r}
set.seed(123)
features_10a <- 20
obs_10a <- 1000

eps_10a <- rnorm(obs_10a)
x_seeds_10a <- rnorm(features_10a)

betas_10a <- rnorm(features_10a)
betas_10a[1] <- 0
betas_10a[5] <- 0
betas_10a[10] <- 0
betas_10a[15] <- 0
betas_10a[20] <- 0

generate_x_10a <- function(seed, nobs){
  rnorm(n = nobs, mean = seed)
}

generate_y_10a <- function(V1, V2, V3, V4, V5, V6, V7, V8, V9, V10, V11, V12, V13, V14, V15, V16, V17, V18, V19, V20, eps_10a, betas_10a){
  y <- V1*betas_10a[1] + V2*betas_10a[2] + V3*betas_10a[3] + V4*betas_10a[4] + V5*betas_10a[5] + V6*betas_10a[6] + V7*betas_10a[7] + V8*betas_10a[8] + V9*betas_10a[9] + V10*betas_10a[10] + V11*betas_10a[11] + V12*betas_10a[12] + V13*betas_10a[13] + V14*betas_10a[14] + V15*betas_10a[15] + V16*betas_10a[16] + V17*betas_10a[17]+ V18*betas_10a[18] + V19*betas_10a[19] + V20*betas_10a[20] + eps_10a
}

tbl_10a <- 
  map_dfc(x_seeds_10a, generate_x_10a, obs_10a) %>%
  add_column(eps_10a)

ls_10a <- map(tbl_10a, list)

y_10a <- pmap(ls_10a, generate_y_10a, betas_10a)

tbl_10a <- tbl_10a %>%
  add_column(y_10a = y_10a[[1]]) %>%
  select(y_10a, everything())

head(tbl_10a)
```

*(b)* Split your data set into a training set containing 100 observations
and a test set containing 900 observations.

>**Answer:** Following is the split

```{r}
set.seed(123)
data_split_10b <- initial_split(tbl_10a %>% select(-eps_10a), prop = 1/10)
data_split_10b_train <- training(data_split_10b)
data_split_10b_test <- testing(data_split_10b)
head(data_split_10b_train)
```

*(c)* Perform best subset selection on the training set, and plot the
training set MSE associated with the best model of each size.

>**Answer:** Following is the subset selection, then the plot

* best subset selection

```{r}
mod_form_10c <- as.formula(y_10a ~ .)

bestsel_10c <- regsubsets(mod_form_10c, data_split_10b_train, nvmax = 20)

tbestsel_10c <- tidy.regsubsets(bestsel_10c) %>%
  mutate(var.number = 1:n()) %>%
  select(var.number, everything())

tbestsel_10c
```

* plot the training MSE

```{r}
predict.regsubsets = function(id, object, formula, newdata, ...){
  form = as.formula(formula)
  mat = model.matrix(form, newdata)
  coefi = coef(object, id=id)
  xvars = names(coefi)
  mat[ , xvars] %*% coefi
}

y_pred_10c <- 
  map_dfc(tbestsel_10c$var.number, 
          predict.regsubsets, 
          object = bestsel_10c, formula = mod_form_10c, newdata = data_split_10b_train)

mse.calculate <- function(y_pred, y_data){
  mean((as.vector(y_pred) - y_data)^2)
}

mse.error <- 
  map_dbl(y_pred_10c, 
          mse.calculate, 
          y_data = data_split_10b_train %>% select(y_10a) %>% pull())

tbestsel_10c_1 <-
bind_cols(
  tbestsel_10c,
  mse = mse.error
)


ggplot(data = tbestsel_10c_1) +
  geom_line(aes(x = var.number, y = mse, group = 1)) +
  geom_point(aes(x = var.number, y = mse), size = 3) +
  xlab("var.number")
```

*(d)* Plot the test set MSE associated with the best model of each
size.

>**Answer:** Following is the test MSE

```{r}
y_pred_10d <- 
  map_dfc(tbestsel_10c$var.number, 
          predict.regsubsets, 
          object = bestsel_10c, formula = mod_form_10c, newdata = data_split_10b_test)

mse.error_10d <- 
  map_dbl(y_pred_10d, 
          mse.calculate, 
          y_data = data_split_10b_test %>% select(y_10a) %>% pull())

tbestsel_10d <-
bind_cols(
  tbestsel_10c,
  mse = mse.error_10d
)


ggplot(data = tbestsel_10d) +
  geom_line(aes(x = var.number, y = mse, group = 1)) +
  geom_point(aes(x = var.number, y = mse), size = 3) +
  xlab("var.number")
```

*(e)* For which model size does the test set MSE take on its minimum
value? Comment on your results. If it takes on its minimum value
for a model containing only an intercept or a model containing
all of the features, then play around with the way that you are
generating the data in (a) until you come up with a scenario in
which the test set MSE is minimized for an intermediate model
size.

>**Answer:** Following is the model with the min test MSE

```{r}
tbestsel_10d %>%
  arrange(mse.error_10d) %>%
  head(1)
```

*(f)* How does the model at which the test set MSE is minimized
compare to the true model used to generate the data? Comment
on the coefficient values.

>**Answer:** Following are the coef, then the comparison with the estimates

* coef

```{r}
coef_10a <- 
  coef(bestsel_10c, id = 13) %>% 
  enframe() %>%
  rename(estimates_13 = value)

coef_10a
```

* comparison between real betas and estimates of the best model

```{r}
betas_10f <-
  betas_10a %>% 
  enframe %>% 
  mutate(name = str_c("V", name)) %>% 
  rename(!!str_c("betas_", nrow(.)) := value) 

betas_10f %>%
  left_join(coef_10a, by = "name") %>%
  mutate(estimates_13 = if_else(is.na(estimates_13), 0, estimates_13))

```

The model has "zero-ed" an additional coef - $\beta_6$

*(g)* Create a plot displaying $\sqrt{\sum_{j=1}^p(\beta_j - \hat{\beta}_j^r)^2}$ for a range of values of $r$, where $\hat\beta_j^r$ is the $j^{th}$ coefficient estimate for the best model containing $r$ coefficients. Comment on what you observe. How does this compare to the test MSE plot from (d)?

>**Answer:** First we data wrangle to create all betas and estimates, then we calculate and finally we plot

* data wrangle

```{r}
get_coef_10g <- function(idx, obj){

  coef(object = obj, id = idx) %>%
    enframe %>%
    right_join(betas_10f %>% select(name), by = "name") %>%
    mutate(!!str_c("estimates_", idx) := if_else(is.na(value), 0, value)) %>%
    select(-name, -value)
}

estimates_10g <- 
  tbestsel_10c$var.number %>%
  map_dfc(get_coef_10g, bestsel_10c)

betas_estimates_10g <-
  estimates_10g %>%
  bind_cols(betas_10f) %>%
  select(name, betas_20, everything())

betas_estimates_10g

```

* calculate and plot

```{r}
sqdiff <- function(est, beta){
  sum((beta - est)^2)
}

map_dfc(betas_estimates_10g %>% select(-name, -betas_20),
        sqdiff,
        betas_estimates_10g %>% select(betas_20)
) %>%
  gather("estimates_1":"estimates_20", key = "coef", value = "diff") %>%
  mutate(coef = as_factor(coef)) %>%
  ggplot() +
  geom_point(aes(x = coef, y = diff), size = 3) +
  geom_line(aes(x = coef, y = diff, group = 1)) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1, vjust = 0.5))
```

Both plots seem quite the same

# *Ex.11* {#ex11}

We will now try to predict per capita crime rate in the `Boston` data
set.

*(a)* Try out some of the regression methods explored in this chapter,
such as best subset selection, the lasso, ridge regression, and
PCR. Present and discuss results for the approaches that you
consider.

>**Answer:** Following are the methods

* `Boston` data look and feel

```{r}
str(Boston)
```

* split the data

```{r}
set.seed(123)
Boston_split <- initial_split(Boston)
Boston_train <- training(Boston_split)
Boston_test <- testing(Boston_split)
```


* best subset

```{r}
mod_form <- 
  as.formula(crim ~ .)

bestsel <- 
  regsubsets(mod_form, Boston_train, nvmax = 20)

tbestsel <- 
  tidy.regsubsets(bestsel) %>%
  mutate(model.number = 1:n()) %>%
  select(model.number, everything())

tbestsel
```

```{r}
graph.bestsubset(tbestsel)
```

Model #7 exhibits optimum parameters - max $R^2$, low $RSS, C_p$ and not bad $BIC$

* the lasso

```{r}
set.seed(123)
# Find the best lambda using cross-validation
x <- model.matrix(mod_form, Boston_train)[,-1]
y <- Boston_train$crim

cv <- cv.glmnet(x, y, alpha = 0)
# Display the best lambda value
# cv$lambda.min

# Fit the final model on the training data
lasso_fit <- glmnet(x, y, alpha = 1, lambda = cv$lambda.min)

# Dsiplay regression coefficients
coef(lasso_fit) #%>% tidy()
```

* ridge regression

```{r}
set.seed(123)
cv_out <- cv.glmnet (x, y, alpha = 0)
ridge_best_lam =cv_out$lambda.min

ridge_fit <- glmnet(x, y, alpha = 0, lambda = ridge_best_lam)

coef(ridge_fit)
```

* PCR fit

```{r}
set.seed(123)
pcr_fit <- pcr(mod_form, data = Boston_train, scale=TRUE, validation ="CV")
summary(pcr_fit)
```

```{r}
validationplot(pcr_fit, val.type="MSEP")
```

PCR with number of comp: #8 exhibits optimum parameters.

*(b)* Propose a model (or set of models) that seem to perform well on
this data set, and justify your answer. Make sure that you are
evaluating model performance using validation set error, crossvalidation,
or some other reasonable alternative, as opposed to
using training error.

* best subset test error

```{r warning=FALSE}
mse.bestsubset(tbestsel, mod_fit = bestsel, mod_form, data_in = Boston_test, "crim")$graph
```

```{r warning=FALSE}
mse.bestsubset(tbestsel, bestsel, mod_form, Boston_test, "crim")$tbl %>%
  select(model.number, mse) %>%
  filter(model.number == 6) %>%
  pull(mse)
```

Model #6 exhibits optimum test error

* lasso test error

```{r}
x_test <- model.matrix(mod_form, Boston_test)[,-1]
y_test <- Boston_test$crim

lasso_pred <- predict(lasso_fit, s = cv$lambda.min, newx = x_test)
lasso_mse <- mean((lasso_pred - y_test)^2)

lasso_mse
```

* ridge test error

```{r}
ridge_pred <- predict(ridge_fit, s = ridge_best_lam, newx = x_test)
ridge_mse <- mean(( ridge_pred - y_test)^2)

ridge_mse
```

* PCR test error

```{r}
pcr_pred <- predict(pcr_fit, Boston_test, ncomp = 8)
pcr_mse <- mean((pcr_pred - Boston_test$crim)^2)

pcr_mse
```

*(c)* Does your chosen model involve all of the features in the data
set? Why or why not?

>**Answer:** PCR with $ncomp = 8$ exhibits the lowest mse test error.
