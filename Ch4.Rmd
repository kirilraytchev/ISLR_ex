# *Ex.1* {#ex1} 

Using a little bit of algebra, prove that (4.2) is equivalent to (4.3). In
other words, the logistic function representation and logit representation
for the logistic regression model are equivalent.

>**Answer:** `r knitr::include_graphics("Ch4Ex1.jpg")`

# *Ex.2* {#ex2}

It was stated in the text that classifying an observation to the class
for which (4.12) is largest is equivalent to classifying an observation
to the class for which (4.13) is largest. Prove that this is the case. In
other words, under the assumption that the observations in the kth
class are drawn from a N($\mu_k$, $\sigma^2$) distribution, the Bayes’ classifier
assigns an observation to the class for which the discriminant function
is maximized.

>**Answer:**  `r knitr::include_graphics("Ch4Ex2.jpg")`

# *Ex.3* {#ex3}

This problem relates to the QDA model, in which the observations
within each class are drawn from a normal distribution with a class specific
mean vector and a class specific covariance matrix. We consider
the simple case where p = 1; i.e. there is only one feature.

Suppose that we have K classes, and that if an observation belongs
to the kth class then X comes from a one-dimensional normal distribution,
X ~ N($\mu_k$, $\sigma^2_k$). Recall that the density function for the
one-dimensional normal distribution is given in (4.11). Prove that in
this case, the Bayes’ classifier is not linear. Argue that it is in fact
quadratic.

# *Ex.4* {#ex4}

When the number of features p is large, there tends to be a deterioration in the performance of KNN and other local approaches that perform prediction using only observations that are near the test observation for which a prediction must be made. This phenomenon is
known as the curse of dimensionality, and it ties into the fact that non-parametric approaches often perform poorly when p is large. We will now investigate this curse.

*(a)* Suppose that we have a set of observations, each with measurements
on p = 1 feature, X. We assume that X is uniformly
(evenly) distributed on [0, 1]. Associated with each observation
is a response value. Suppose that we wish to predict a test observation’s
response using only observations that are within 10% of
the range of X closest to that test observation. For instance, in
order to predict the response for a test observation with X = 0.6,
we will use observations in the range [0.55, 0.65]. On average,
what fraction of the available observations will we use to make
the prediction?

>**Answer:** $avg. fraction = 0.1$

*(b)* Now suppose that we have a set of observations, each with
measurements on p = 2 features, X1 and X2. We assume that
(X1,X2) are uniformly distributed on [0, 1] × [0, 1]. We wish to
predict a test observation’s response using only observations that
are within 10% of the range of X1 and within 10% of the range
of X2 closest to that test observation. For instance, in order to
predict the response for a test observation with X1 = 0.6 and
X2 = 0.35, we will use observations in the range [0.55, 0.65] for
X1 and in the range [0.3, 0.4] for X2. On average, what fraction
of the available observations will we use to make the prediction?

>**Answer:** $avg. fraction = 0.1^2 = `r 0.1^2`$

*(c)* Now suppose that we have a set of observations on p = 100 features.
Again the observations are uniformly distributed on each
feature, and again each feature ranges in value from 0 to 1. We
wish to predict a test observation’s response using observations
within the 10% of each feature’s range that is closest to that test
observation. What fraction of the available observations will we
use to make the prediction?

>**Answer:** $avg. fraction = 0.1^{100} = 0.0...$

*(d)* Using your answers to parts (a)–(c), argue that a drawback of
KNN when p is large is that there are very few training observations
“near” any given test observation.

>**Answer:** K observations that are nearest to a given test observation x0 may be
very far away from x0 in p-dimensional space when p is large, leading to a very poor prediction of f(x0) and hence a poor KNN fit. (p.109)

*(e)* Now suppose that we wish to make a prediction for a test observation
by creating a p-dimensional hypercube centered around
the test observation that contains, on average, 10% of the training
observations. For p = 1, 2, and 100, what is the length of
each side of the hypercube? Comment on your answer.

>**Answer:**  The higher the dimension, the bigger the hypercube needs to be to keep using 10%. For $p = 100$ hypercube gets almost the same as the whole set of training observations.    
$p = 1, length = 0.1^1 \times 1^1 = `r 0.1 * 1`$  
$p = 2, length = 0.1^{1/2} \times 1^2 = `r 0.1^(1/2) * 1^2`$  
$p = 100, length = 0.1^{1/100} \times 1^{100} = `r 0.1^(1/100) * 1^100`$

# *Ex.5* {#ex5}

We now examine the differences between LDA and QDA.

*(a)* If the Bayes decision boundary is linear, do we expect LDA or
QDA to perform better on the training set? On the test set?

>**Answer:** We expect QDA to perform better on the training set as it is more flexible method, but worse on the test set as the true function is linear and QDA will result with higher bias.

*(b)* If the Bayes decision boundary is non-linear, do we expect LDA
or QDA to perform better on the training set? On the test set?

>**Answer:** We expect QDA to perform better on both the training and test set.

*(c)* In general, as the sample size n increases, do we expect the test
prediction accuracy of QDA relative to LDA to improve, decline,
or be unchanged? Why?

>**Answer:** As n increases we expect the test prediction accuracy of QDA, relative to LDA, to improve because QDA is more flexible method; has lower bias and high variance is compensated by the large number of n.

*(d)* True or False: Even if the Bayes decision boundary for a given
problem is linear, we will probably achieve a superior test error
rate using QDA rather than LDA because QDA is flexible
enough to model a linear decision boundary. Justify your answer.

>**Answer:** False. QDA will suffer from higher variance without a corresponding decrease in bias.

# *Ex.6* {#ex6}

Suppose we collect data for a group of students in a statistics class
with variables X1 =hours studied, X2 =undergrad GPA, and Y =
receive an A. We fit a logistic regression and produce estimated
coefficient, $\hat\beta_0 = -6$, $\hat\beta_1 = 0.05$, $\hat\beta_2 = 1$.

*(a)* Estimate the probability that a student who studies for 40 h and
has an undergrad GPA of 3.5 gets an A in the class.

>**Answer:** 

```{r}
x_1 <- 40
x_2 <- 3.5

beta_0 <- -6
beta_1 <- 0.05
beta_2 <- 1

Prob_Get_A <- exp(beta_0 + beta_1*x_1 + beta_2*x_2)/(1 + exp(beta_0 + beta_1*x_1 + beta_2*x_2))

percent(Prob_Get_A)
```

*(b)* How many hours would the student in part (a) need to study to
have a 50% chance of getting an A in the class?

>**Answer:** 

```{r}
x_1 <- (log(0.5/(1-0.5)) - beta_0 - beta_2*x_2)/beta_1
x_1

rm(list = ls())
```

# *Ex.7* {#ex7}

Suppose that we wish to predict whether a given stock will issue a
dividend this year (“Yes” or “No”) based on X, last year’s percent
profit.We examine a large number of companies and discover that the
mean value of X for companies that issued a dividend was $\overline{X} = 10$,
while the mean for those that didn’t was $\overline{X} = 0$. In addition, the
variance of X for these two sets of companies was $\hat\sigma^2 = 36$. Finally,
80% of companies issued dividends. Assuming that X follows a normal
distribution, predict the probability that a company will issue
a dividend this year given that its percentage profit was X = 4 last
year.

>**Answer:**

```{r}
miu_1 <- 10
miu_2 <- 0
sigma <- sqrt(36)
pai_1 <- 0.8
x <- 4

f_1 <- (1/sqrt(2*pi*sigma))*exp((-1/(2*sigma^2))*(x-miu_1)^2)

f_2 <- (1/sqrt(2*pi*sigma))*exp((-1/(2*sigma^2))*(x-miu_2)^2)

Prob_Get_Divident <- (pai_1*f_1)/(pai_1*f_1 + (1-pai_1)*f_2)
percent(Prob_Get_Divident)
rm(list = ls())
```

# *Ex.8* {#ex8}

Suppose that we take a data set, divide it into equally-sized training
and test sets, and then try out two different classification procedures.
First we use logistic regression and get an error rate of 20% on the
training data and 30% on the test data. Next we use 1-nearest neighbors
(i.e. K = 1) and get an average error rate (averaged over both
test and training data sets) of 18%. Based on these results, which
method should we prefer to use for classification of new observations?
Why?

>**Answer:** When K = 1, the KNN fit perfectly interpolates the training observations so training error would be 0% and testing - 72%. Logistic regression should be preferred with 30% error rate on the test data.

# *Ex.9* {#ex9}

This problem has to do with odds.

*(a)* On average, what fraction of people with an odds of 0.37 of
defaulting on their credit card payment will in fact default?

>**Answer:** We solve $0.37 = \frac{x}{1-x}$.

```{r}
odds <- 0.37

x <- odds/(1+odds)
```

On average `r percent(x)` of people with an odds of `r odds` will default.

*(b)* Suppose that an individual has a 16% chance of defaulting on
her credit card payment. What are the odds that she will default?

>**Answer:** We solve $odds = \frac{0.16}{1-0.16}$

```{r}
rm(list = ls())
x <- 0.16
odds <- x/(1-x)
```

The odds of an individual that has 16% chance of default are `r percent(odds)`

This question should be answered using the Weekly data set, which
is part of the ISLR package. This data is similar in nature to the
Smarket data from this chapter’s lab, except that it contains 1, 089
weekly returns for 21 years, from the beginning of 1990 to the end of
2010.

*(a)* Produce some numerical and graphical summaries of the Weekly
data. Do there appear to be any patterns?

>**Answer:** ....(in progress)
