## Conceptual
*Ex.1* For each of parts (a) through (d), indicate whether we would generally
expect the performance of a flexible statistical learning method to be
better or worse than an inflexible method. Justify your answer.

*(a)* The sample size n is extremely large, and the number of predictors
p is small.  

>**Answer:** Flexible is better. Large sample leads to low variance and low bias if flexible method is used.

*(b)* The number of predictors p is extremely large, and the number
of observations n is small.

>**Answer:** Flexible is worse. Small sample leads to high variance.

*(c)* The relationship between the predictors and response is highly
non-linear.

>**Answer:** Flexible is better. Low bias.

*(d)* The variance of the error terms, i.e. Ïƒ2 = Var(epsilon), is extremely
high.

>**Answer:** Flexible is worse. A lot of "noise" would be reflected by the model.

*Ex.2* Explain whether each scenario is a classification or regression problem,
and indicate whether we are most interested in inference or prediction.
Finally, provide n and p.

*(a)* We collect a set of data on the top 500 firms in the US. For each
firm we record profit, number of employees, industry and the
CEO salary. We are interested in understanding which factors
affect CEO salary.

>**Answer:** Regression. Inference. `n = 500`, `p = profit + employees + industry`

*(b)* We are considering launching a new product and wish to know
whether it will be a success or a failure. We collect data on 20
similar products that were previously launched. For each product
we have recorded whether it was a success or failure, price
charged for the product, marketing budget, competition price,
and ten other variables.

>**Answer:** Classification. Prediction. `n = 20`, `p = price.charged + budget + comp.price + ....`

*(c)* We are interest in predicting the % change in the USD/Euro
exchange rate in relation to the weekly changes in the world
stock markets. Hence we collect weekly data for all of 2012. For
each week we record the % change in the USD/Euro, the %
change in the US market, the % change in the British market,
and the % change in the German market.

>**Answer:** Regression. Prediction. `n = nbr. of weeks in 2012`, `p = US + GB + DE`

*Ex.3* We now revisit the bias-variance decomposition.

*(a)* Provide a sketch of typical (squared) bias, variance, training error,
test error, and Bayes (or irreducible) error curves, on a single
plot, as we go from less flexible statistical learning methods
towards more flexible approaches. The x-axis should represent the amount of flexibility in the method, and the y-axis should represent the values for each curve. There should be five curves. Make sure to label each one.

![Answer](Ch2Ex3a.jpg)

*(b)* Explain why each of the five curves has the shape displayed in
part (a).

>**Answer:**  
1. bias - model line approximates better when flex. increases => model error decreases;  
2. variance - increases becauses different training data would give higher deviation for more flexible models;  
3. training error - more drgrees of freedom leads to better approximation;  
4. test error - reflects bias and variance;  
5. bayes error - irreducible error;    

*Ex.4* You will now think of some real-life applications for statistical learning.

*(a)* Describe three real-life applications in which classification might
be useful. Describe the response, as well as the predictors. Is the
goal of each application inference or prediction? Explain your
answer.

>**Answer:**  
1. Energy efficiency classification:   
response -> classes A; B; C; D;  
predictors -> electr. consumption + heat consumption + other consumption;  
goal -> prediction.  
2. User reaction to smart phone notification:  
response -> notification tapped/untapped
predictors -> user activity + call to action type + color set + weather conditions;  
goal -> inference. Tuning for effective notifications.  
3. User action to smart phone app suggested action:  
response -> action taken/not taken;  
predictors -> type of value proposition + color set + type of picture used + suggested action type;  
goal -> inferece. Tuning for action-oriented communication with the user.  

*(b)* Describe three real-life applications in which regression might
be useful. Describe the response, as well as the predictors. Is the
goal of each application inference or prediction? Explain your
answer.

>**Answer:**  
1. Energy consumption:  
response -> kwh;  
predictors -> weather + occupancy + area + type of building;  
goal -> prediction. Predict energy expenses.  
2. Behavior energy savings:  
response -> kwh;  
predictors -> age + number of occupants + type of building + number of teams + avg. salary + type of area;  
goal -> prediction of behavior energy saving measures for buildings.  
3. Energy savings:  
response -> kwh;  
predictors -> type of building + present specific consumption + area + type of energy saving measures;  
goal -> prediction of energy savings

*(c)* Describe three real-life applications in which cluster analysis
might be useful.

>**Answer:**  
1. Classification of Building stock in terms energy saving opportunities;  
2. User types in terms of reaction to notifications;  
3. User types in terms of actions taken.  

*Ex.5* What are the advantages and disadvantages of a very flexible (versus
a less flexible) approach for regression or classification? Under what
circumstances might a more flexible approach be preferred to a less
flexible approach? When might a less flexible approach be preferred?

>**Answer:**  
Adv. -> low training error; low bias/Disadv. -> high variance;  
More flex. is preferred when we have a lot of non-linear training data;  
Less flex. is preferred when we have linear training data; 

*Ex.6* Describe the differences between a parametric and a non-parametric
statistical learning approach. What are the advantages of a parametric
approach to regression or classification (as opposed to a nonparametric
approach)? What are its disadvantages?

>**Answer:**
In param. approach we assume the form of the function / In non-param we do not;   
Adv. of param. approach is that it is simpler to estimate just the coeff. of the chosen form of function;  
Disadv. of param. approach is that the assumption for the form of the function might be wrong.

*Ex.7* The table below provides a training data set containing six observations,
three predictors, and one qualitative response variable.

```{r}

tbl <-
        tibble(
                Obs = 1:6,
                X1 = c(0,2,0,0,-1,1),
                X2 = c(3,0,1,1,0,1),
                X3 = c(0,0,3,2,1,1),
                Y = factor(c("Red", "Red", "Red", "Green", "Green", "Red"))
        )
tbl
```

Suppose we wish to use this data set to make a prediction for Y when
X1 = X2 = X3 = 0 using K-nearest neighbors.

*(a)* Compute the Euclidean distance between each observation and
the test point, X1 = X2 = X3 = 0.

>**Answer:**

```{r}
X0 <- 
        c(0,0,0)        
        
tbl_X <-
        tbl %>%
        select(X1, X2, X3) %>%
        t() %>%
        as.tibble()


Dist <-
        map(tbl_X, function(x) {(x - X0)^2}) %>%
        map_dbl(sum) %>%
        map_dbl(sqrt) 

tbl_D <-
        tbl %>%
        add_column(
                Distance = Dist
        )

tbl_D
```

*(b)* What is our prediction with K = 1? Why?

>**Answer:**  
Green;  
The closest point is Green.

*(c)* What is our prediction with K = 3? Why?

>**Answer:**  
Red;  
We have closest 2 red and 1 green points.

*(d)* If the Bayes decision boundary in this problem is highly nonlinear,
then would we expect the best value for K to be large or
small? Why?

>**Answer:**  
Best value for **K** is small. Then it would be more flexible and go with the nonlinear boundry.
