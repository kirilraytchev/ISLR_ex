Using basic statistical properties of the variance, as well as single variable
calculus, derive (5.6). In other words, prove that $\alpha$ given by
(5.6) does indeed minimize Var($\alpha$X + (1 − $\alpha$)Y ).

# *Ex.2* {#ex2}

We will now derive the probability that a given observation is part
of a bootstrap sample. Suppose that we obtain a bootstrap sample
from a set of $n$ observations.

*(a)* What is the probability that the first bootstrap observation is
not the $j$th observation from the original sample? Justify your
answer.

>**Answer:** $1 - \frac{1}{n}$

*(b)* What is the probability that the second bootstrap observation
is not the $j$th observation from the original sample?

>**Answer:** Due to the fact that sampling is performed with replacement, we have the same answer as in *(a)* $1 - \frac{1}{n}$

*(c)* Argue that the probability that the $j$th observation is not in the
bootstrap sample is $(1 − 1/n)^n$.

>**Answer:** Since we deal with independent probabilities, the probability that the $j$th observation is not in the sample is the product of probabilities of each observation not being in the sample.

*(d)* When n = 5, what is the probability that the $j$th observation is
in the bootstrap sample?

>**Answer:** We use the procedure below to find:

```{r}
percent(1-(1-1/5)^5)
```

*(e)* When n = 100, what is the probability that the jth observation
is in the bootstrap sample?

>**Answer:** We use the procedure below to find:

```{r}
percent(1-(1-1/100)^100)
```

*(f)* When n = 10, 000, what is the probability that the jth observation
is in the bootstrap sample?

>**Answer:** We use the procedure below to find:

```{r}
percent(1-(1-1/10000)^10000)
```

*(g)* Create a plot that displays, for each integer value of n from 1
to 100, 000, the probability that the jth observation is in the
bootstrap sample. Comment on what you observe.

>**Answer:** We use the code below to create:

```{r}
x <- 1:100000
y <- 1-(1-1/x)^x
ggplot() +
        geom_point(aes(x, y))
```

Probability quickly reaches the values calculated in *(e)* and *(f)*.

*(h)* We will now investigate numerically the probability that a bootstrap
sample of size n = 100 contains the $j$th observation. Here
j = 4. We repeatedly create bootstrap samples, and each time
we record whether or not the fourth observation is contained in
the bootstrap sample.

 store=rep (NA , 10000)
 for (i in 1:10000) {
        store[i]=sum(sample (1:100 , rep =TRUE)==4) >0
 }
 mean(store)

Comment on the results obtained.

>**Answer:** We use the code below to obtain the results:

```{r}
 store=rep (NA , 10000)
 for (i in 1:10000) {
        store[i]=sum(sample (1:100 , rep =TRUE)==4) >0
 }
 mean(store)
```

which is close to what we calculate with formula in *(f)*: `r percent(1-(1-1/10000)^10000)`

# *Ex.3* {#ex3}

We now review k-fold cross-validation.

*(a)* Explain how k-fold cross-validation is implemented.

>**Answer:** This approach involves randomly dividing the set of observations into k groups, or folds, of approximately equal size. The first fold is treated as a validation set, and the method
is fit on the remaining k − 1 folds. (book_ref. 5.1.3)

*(b)* What are the advantages and disadvantages of k-fold cross validation
relative to:

*(i)* The validation set approach?
        
>**Answer:** The advantages are:   
1. Lower variability;   
2. More accurate test error estimates.  
The disadvantages are:   
1. Computational.

*(ii)* LOOCV?

>**Answer:** The advantages are:   
1. Computational;   
2. More accurate test error estimates (book_ref. 5.1.4).   
The disadvantages are:   
1. Higher variability.

# *Ex.4* {#ex4}

Suppose that we use some statistical learning method to make a prediction
for the response Y for a particular value of the predictor X.
Carefully describe how we might estimate the standard deviation of
our prediction.

>**Answer:** We can use the bootstrap approach. First, we predict *B-number of times* with replacement **Y** for particular values of **X**. Second, we compute the SE of the estimates by using formula (5.8)

In Chapter 4, we used logistic regression to predict the probability of
default using `income` and `balance` on the `Default` data set. We will
now estimate the test error of this logistic regression model using the
validation set approach. Do not forget to set a random seed before
beginning your analysis.

```{r}
set.seed(123)
```

*(a)* Fit a logistic regression model that uses `income` and `balance` to
predict `default`.

>**Answer:** Following is the fit:

```{r}
logreg_mod <- logistic_reg()

logreg_fit <-
  logreg_mod %>%
  set_engine("glm") %>%
  fit(default ~ income + balance, data = Default)

logreg_fit$fit %>% broom::tidy()
```

*(b)* Using the validation set approach, estimate the test error of this
model. In order to do this, you must perform the following steps:

*(i)* Split the sample set into a training set and a validation set.

>**Answer:** Following is the split:

```{r}
DefaultSplit <- initial_split(Default) 
```

*(ii)* Fit a multiple logistic regression model using only the training
observations.

>**Answer:** Following is the fit:

```{r}
logreg_fit_ii <-
  logreg_mod %>%
  set_engine("glm") %>%
  fit(default ~ income + balance, data = training(DefaultSplit))

logreg_fit_ii$fit %>% broom::tidy()
```

*(iii)* Obtain a prediction of default status for each individual in
the validation set by computing the posterior probability of
default for that individual, and classifying the individual to
the `default` category if the posterior probability is greater
than 0.5.

>**Answer:** Following is the prediction:

```{r}
logreg_preds <- predict(logreg_fit_ii, type = "prob", testing(DefaultSplit)) %>%
  mutate(.pred_default = as_factor(ifelse(.pred_Yes > 0.5, "Yes", "No")))

logreg_preds
```

*(iv)* Compute the validation set error, which is the fraction of
the observations in the validation set that are misclassified.

>**Answer:** Following is the computation:

```{r}
valid_set_error <- logreg_preds %>%
  bind_cols(testing(DefaultSplit)) %>%
  select(.pred_default, default) %>%
  mutate(valid = if_else(.pred_default == default, 1, 0)) %>%
  summarise(
    total_valid = sum(valid),
    total = n(),
    valid_set_error = total_valid/total
  ) %>%
  pull(valid_set_error)

percent(1-valid_set_error)
```



*(c)* Repeat the process in (b) three times, using three different splits
of the observations into a training set and a validation set. Comment
on the results obtained. 

```{r}
rm(list = ls())
```

>**Answer:** We repeat the process, defining different seeds, in the following code:

* 1st time

```{r}
set.seed(111)
logreg_mod <- logistic_reg()

DefaultSplit_1st <- initial_split(Default, prop = 1/2)
train_1st <- training(DefaultSplit_1st)
test_1st <- testing(DefaultSplit_1st)

logreg_fit_1st <-
  logreg_mod %>%
  set_engine("glm") %>%
  fit(default ~ income + balance, data = train_1st)

logreg_preds_1st <- predict(logreg_fit_1st, type = "prob", test_1st) %>%
  mutate(.pred_default = as_factor(ifelse(.pred_Yes > 0.5, "Yes", "No")))

vseterror_1st <- logreg_preds_1st %>%
  bind_cols(test_1st) %>%
  select(.pred_default, default) %>%
  mutate(valid = if_else(.pred_default == default, 1, 0)) %>%
  summarise(
    total_valid = sum(valid),
    total = n(),
    valid_set_error = total_valid/total
  ) %>%
  pull(valid_set_error)

percent(1-vseterror_1st)
```

* 2nd time

```{r}
set.seed(222)
logreg_mod <- logistic_reg()

DefaultSplit_2nd <- initial_split(Default, prop = 1/2)
train_2nd <- training(DefaultSplit_2nd)
test_2nd <- testing(DefaultSplit_2nd)

logreg_fit_2nd <-
  logreg_mod %>%
  set_engine("glm") %>%
  fit(default ~ income + balance, data = train_2nd)

logreg_preds_2nd <- predict(logreg_fit_2nd, type = "prob", test_2nd) %>%
  mutate(.pred_default = as_factor(ifelse(.pred_Yes > 0.5, "Yes", "No")))

vseterror_2nd <- logreg_preds_2nd %>%
  bind_cols(test_2nd) %>%
  select(.pred_default, default) %>%
  mutate(valid = if_else(.pred_default == default, 1, 0)) %>%
  summarise(
    total_valid = sum(valid),
    total = n(),
    valid_set_error = total_valid/total
  ) %>%
  pull(valid_set_error)

percent(1-vseterror_2nd)
```

* 3rd time

```{r}
set.seed(333)
logreg_mod <- logistic_reg()

DefaultSplit_3rd <- initial_split(Default, prop = 1/2)
train_3rd <- training(DefaultSplit_3rd)
test_3rd <- testing(DefaultSplit_3rd)

logreg_fit_3rd <-
  logreg_mod %>%
  set_engine("glm") %>%
  fit(default ~ income + balance, data = train_3rd)

logreg_preds_3rd <- predict(logreg_fit_3rd, type = "prob", test_3rd) %>%
  mutate(.pred_default = as_factor(ifelse(.pred_Yes > 0.5, "Yes", "No")))

vseterror_3rd <- logreg_preds_3rd %>%
  bind_cols(test_3rd) %>%
  select(.pred_default, default) %>%
  mutate(valid = if_else(.pred_default == default, 1, 0)) %>%
  summarise(
    total_valid = sum(valid),
    total = n(),
    valid_set_error = total_valid/total
  ) %>%
  pull(valid_set_error)

percent(1-vseterror_3rd)
```

Validation test error rate varies depending on the split.

```{r}
rm(list = ls())
```

*(d)* Now consider a logistic regression model that predicts the probability
of `default` using `income`, `balance`, and a dummy variable
for `student`. Estimate the test error for this model using the validation
set approach. Comment on whether or not including a
dummy variable for student leads to a reduction in the test error
rate.

>**Answer:** Following is the code for estimation of the test error:

```{r}
set.seed(123)
logreg_mod <- logistic_reg()

DefaultSplit <- initial_split(Default)
training <- training(DefaultSplit)
testing <- testing(DefaultSplit)

logreg_fit <-
  logreg_mod %>%
  set_engine("glm") %>%
  fit(default ~ income + balance + student, data = training)

logreg_preds <- predict(logreg_fit, type = "prob", testing) %>%
  mutate(.pred_default = as_factor(ifelse(.pred_Yes > 0.5, "Yes", "No")))

vseterror <- logreg_preds %>%
  bind_cols(testing) %>%
  select(.pred_default, default) %>%
  mutate(valid = if_else(.pred_default == default, 1, 0)) %>%
  summarise(
    total_valid = sum(valid),
    total = n(),
    valid_set_error = total_valid/total
  ) %>%
  pull(valid_set_error)

percent(1-vseterror)
```

Adding `student` doesn't reduce the validation test error.

```{r}
rm(list = ls())
```

# *Ex.6* {#ex6}

We continue to consider the use of a logistic regression model to
predict the probability of `default` using `income` and `balance` on the
`Default` data set. In particular, we will now compute estimates for
the standard errors of the `income` and `balance` logistic regression coefficients
in two different ways: (1) using the bootstrap, and (2) using
the standard formula for computing the standard errors in the `glm()`
function. Do not forget to set a random seed before beginning your
analysis.

*(a)* Using the `summary()` and `glm()` functions, determine the estimated
standard errors for the coefficients associated with `income`
and `balance` in a multiple logistic regression model that uses
both predictors.

>**Answer:** Following is the code for estimation of the std.error

```{r}
logreg_mod <- logistic_reg()

logreg_fit <-
  logreg_mod %>%
  set_engine("glm") %>%
  fit(default ~ income + balance, data = Default)

summary_betas <- 
  logreg_fit$fit %>% 
  broom::tidy() %>% 
  arrange(term) %>%
  select(std.error) %>%
  transmute(
    std.error.summary = std.error
  )

logreg_fit$fit %>% 
  broom::tidy() %>% 
  arrange(term)
```

*(b)* Write a function, boot.fn(), that takes as input the Default data
set as well as an index of the observations, and that outputs
the coefficient estimates for income and balance in the multiple
logistic regression model.

*(c)* Use the boot() function together with your boot.fn() function to
estimate the standard errors of the logistic regression coefficients
for income and balance.

>**Answer (b), (c):** Following is the estimation of the std.errors:

```{r}
set.seed(1)
logreg_mod <- logistic_reg()

logreg_fit <-
  logreg_mod %>%
  set_engine("glm")

bt_resamples <- bootstraps(Default, times = 250)

mod_form <- as.formula(default ~ income + balance)

glm_coefs <- function(splits, ...) {
  mod <- logreg_fit %>% fit(..., data = analysis(splits))
  mod$fit %>% 
    broom::tidy()
}

bt_resamples$betas <- map(.x = bt_resamples$splits, 
                          .f = glm_coefs, 
                          mod_form)

bt_resamples %>% 
  unnest(betas) %>%
  select(term, estimate) %>%
  group_by(term) %>%
  summarise(
    betas = mean(estimate),
    std.error.boot = sd(estimate),
  ) %>%
  arrange(term) %>%
  bind_cols(
    summary_betas
  )
```


*(d)* Comment on the estimated standard errors obtained using the
`glm()` function and using your bootstrap function.

>**Answer:** The estimated standard errors are pretty close.

```{r}
rm(list = ls())
```

# *Ex.7* {#ex7}

In Sections 5.3.2 and 5.3.3, we saw that the `cv.glm()` function can be
used in order to compute the LOOCV test error estimate. Alternatively,
one could compute those quantities using just the `glm()` and
`predict.glm()` functions, and a for loop. You will now take this approach
in order to compute the LOOCV error for a simple logistic
regression model on the `Weekly` data set. Recall that in the context
of classification problems, the LOOCV error is given in (5.4).

*(a)* Fit a logistic regression model that predicts `Direction` using `Lag1`
and `Lag2`.

>**Answer:** Following is the fit:

```{r}
set.seed(123)
logreg_mod <- logistic_reg()

mod_form <- as.formula(Direction ~ Lag1 + Lag2)

logreg_fit <-
  logreg_mod %>%
  set_engine("glm") %>%
  fit(mod_form, data = Weekly)

logreg_fit$fit %>% broom::tidy()
```

*(b)* Fit a logistic regression model that predicts `Direction` using `Lag1`
and `Lag2` using all but the first observation.

*(c)* Use the model from (b) to predict the direction of the first observation.
You can do this by predicting that the first observation
will go up if P(`Direction="Up"|Lag1, Lag2`) > 0.5. Was this observation
correctly classified?

*(d)* Write a for loop from $i$ = 1 to $i = n$, where $n$ is the number of
observations in the data set, that performs each of the following
steps:

*(i)* Fit a logistic regression model using all but the $i$th observation
to predict `Direction` using `Lag1` and `Lag2`.

*(ii)* Compute the posterior probability of the market moving up
for the $i$th observation.

*(iii)* Use the posterior probability for the $i$th observation in order
to predict whether or not the market moves up.

*(iv)* Determine whether or not an error was made in predicting
the direction for the $i$th observation. If an error was made,
then indicate this as a 1, and otherwise indicate it as a 0.

*(e)* Take the average of the $n$ numbers obtained in (d)iv in order to
obtain the LOOCV estimate for the test error. Comment on the
results.

>**Answer:** Following is the code to obtain the LOOCV estimate for the test error:

```{r}
set.seed(123)
mod_form <- as.formula(Direction ~ Lag1 + Lag2)

loo_resamples_weekly <- loo_cv(Weekly)

holdout_results <- function(splits, ...) {

  mod <- glm(..., data = analysis(splits), family = binomial)

  holdout <- assessment(splits)

  res <- broom::augment(mod, newdata = holdout, type.predict = "response")
 
  prediction <- as_factor(ifelse(res$.fitted > 0.5, "Up", "Down"))
  # Calculate whether the prediction was correct
  res$wrong <- prediction != holdout$Direction
  
  # Return the assessment data set with the additional columns
  res
}

loo_resamples_weekly$results <- map(loo_resamples_weekly$splits, holdout_results, mod_form)

test_error <- loo_resamples_weekly %>% 
  unnest(results) %>%
  summarise(
    test.error = mean(wrong)
  ) %>%
  pull

percent(test_error)
```

```{r}
#Clean-up
rm(list = ls())
```

# *Ex.8* {#ex8}

We will now perform cross-validation on a simulated data set.

*(a)* Generate a simulated data set as follows:

```{r}
set.seed(1)
x <- rnorm(100)
y <- x - 2 * x^2 + rnorm(100)
```

In this data set, what is $n$ and what is $p$? Write out the model
used to generate the data in equation form.

>**Answer:** $n = `r length(y)`$, $p = 1$, $Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \times X_1 - \beta_2 \times X_1^2 + \epsilon$

*(b)* Create a scatterplot of X against Y . Comment on what you find.

>**Answer:** Following is the plot:

```{r}
ggplot() + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = x, y = y))
```

We observe a parabolic relationship.

*(c)* Set a random seed, and then compute the LOOCV errors that
result from fitting the following four models using least squares:

*i.* $Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1X + \epsilon$  
*ii.* $Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1X + \beta_2X_2^2 + \epsilon$  
*iii.* $Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1X + \beta_2X_2^2 + \beta_3X_3^3 + \epsilon$  
*iv.* $Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1X + \beta_2X_2^2 + \beta_3X_3^3 + \beta_4X_4^4 + \epsilon$  

```{r}
data <- tibble(
  x = x,
  y = y
)
```


>**Answer:** Following is the code that computes the LOOCV errors:

* Model i.

```{r}
set.seed(1)
mod_form <- as.formula(y ~ x)

loo_samples <- loo_cv(data)

holdout_results <- function(splits, ...) {

  mod <- glm(..., data = analysis(splits))

  holdout <- assessment(splits)

  res <- broom::augment(mod, newdata = holdout)
 
  # Calculate the MSE
  res$mse <- (res$y - res$.fitted)^2
  
  # Return the assessment data set with the additional columns
  res
}

loo_samples$results <- map(loo_samples$splits, holdout_results, mod_form)

mse_error <- loo_samples %>%
  unnest(results) %>%
  summarise(
    mse = mean(mse)
  ) %>%
  pull

tblrez <- tibble(
  degree = 1,
  mse = mse_error,
)

tblrez
```

* Model ii.

```{r}
mod_form <- as.formula(y ~ poly(x, 2))
loo_samples$results <- map(loo_samples$splits, holdout_results, mod_form)

mse_error <- loo_samples %>%
  unnest(results) %>%
  summarise(
    mse = mean(mse)
  ) %>%
  pull

tblrez <- tblrez %>% add_row(degree = 2, mse = mse_error)

tblrez[2, ]
```

* Model iii.

```{r}
mod_form <- as.formula(y ~ poly(x, 3))
loo_samples$results <- map(loo_samples$splits, holdout_results, mod_form)

mse_error <- loo_samples %>%
  unnest(results) %>%
  summarise(
    mse = mean(mse)
  ) %>%
  pull

tblrez <- tblrez %>% add_row(degree = 3, mse = mse_error)

tblrez[3, ]
```

* Model iv.

```{r}
mod_form <- as.formula(y ~ poly(x, 4))
loo_samples$results <- map(loo_samples$splits, holdout_results, mod_form)

mse_error <- loo_samples %>%
  unnest(results) %>%
  summarise(
    mse = mean(mse)
  ) %>%
  pull

tblrez <- tblrez %>% add_row(degree = 4, mse = mse_error)

tblrez[4, ]
```

*(d)* Repeat (c) using another random seed, and report your results.
Are your results the same as what you got in (c)? Why?

>**Answer:** Following is the code using another random seed:

```{r}
set.seed(111)

get_mse_errors <- function(n, dataset){
  mod_form <- as.formula(y ~ poly(x, n))
  loo_samples <- loo_cv(dataset)
  loo_samples$results <- map(loo_samples$splits, holdout_results, mod_form)
  
  mse_error <- loo_samples %>%
    unnest(results) %>%
    summarise(
      mse = mean(mse)
    ) %>%
    pull
  
  mse_error
}


mse <- map_dbl(1:4, get_mse_errors, data)
mse
```

The results are practically the same. In both cases, (c) and (d), we have used the same data, samples to model and one-out to validate.

*(e)* Which of the models in (c) had the smallest LOOCV error? Is
this what you expected? Explain your answer.

>**Answer:** Following is a graphical representation of results and explanation:

```{r}
ggplot(data = tblrez) +
  geom_line(aes(y = mse, x = degree))
```

2nd degree exhibits the lowest error, which is expected and coincides with the way we generated the dataset.

*(f)* Comment on the statistical significance of the coefficient estimates
that results from fitting each of the models in (c) using
least squares. Do these results agree with the conclusions drawn
based on the cross-validation results?

>**Answer:** Following is the coef estimates and after that the answers:

```{r}
    glm(y ~ poly(x, 4), data = data) %>%
      tidy
```

1st and 2nd degree coef are only statistically significant which coincides with the results obtained from LOOCV method.

# *Ex.9* {#ex9}

We will now consider the `Boston` housing data set, from the `MASS`
library.

*(a)* Based on this data set, provide an estimate for the population
mean of `medv`. Call this estimate $\hat{\mu}$.

>**Answer:** Following is the code for estimation:

```{r}
miu.hat <- mean(Boston$medv)
miu.hat
```

*(b)* Provide an estimate of the standard error of $\hat{\mu}$. Interpret this
result.

>**Answer:** Following is the code for estimation:

```{r}
std.error_miuhat <- sd(Boston$medv)/sqrt(nrow(Boston))
std.error_miuhat
```

We are now able to calculate 95% confidence interval [`r miu.hat` - `r 1.96 * std.error_miuhat`] and [`r miu.hat` + `r 1.96 * std.error_miuhat`].

*(c)* Now estimate the standard error of $\hat{\mu}$ using the bootstrap. How
does this compare to your answer from (b)?

>**Answer:** Following is the code for estimation using the bootstrap:

```{r}
set.seed(1)
bt_resamples <- bootstraps(Boston, times = 1000)

get_mean_sample <- function(splits){
  rez  <- mean(analysis(splits)$medv)
  rez
}

bt_resamples$means <- map(.x = bt_resamples$splits, 
                          .f = get_mean_sample
) 

bt_std.error_miuhat <- bt_resamples %>%
  unnest(means) %>%
  summarize(
    mean = mean(means),
    std.error = sd(means)
  ) %>%
  pull(std.error)

bt_mean_miuhat <- bt_resamples %>%
  unnest(means) %>%
  summarize(
    mean = mean(means),
    std.error = sd(means)
  ) %>%
  pull(mean)

bt_std.error_miuhat
```

The answer is comparable to (b).

*(d)* Based on your bootstrap estimate from (c), provide a 95% confidence
interval for the mean of `medv`. Compare it to the results
obtained using `t.test(Boston$medv)`.

>**Answer:** Following is the 95% interval and after that the results from `t.test`

[`r bt_mean_miuhat - 1.96 * bt_std.error_miuhat` , `r bt_mean_miuhat + 1.96 * bt_std.error_miuhat`]

```{r}
t.test(Boston$medv)
```

The results are identical.

*(e)* Based on this data set, provide an estimate, $\hat{\mu}_{med}$, for the median
value of medv in the population.

>**Answer:** Following is the code for the estimate:

```{r}
med.hat <- median(Boston$medv)
med.hat
```

*(f)* We now would like to estimate the standard error of $\hat{\mu}_{med}$. Unfortunately,
there is no simple formula for computing the standard
error of the median. Instead, estimate the standard error of the
median using the bootstrap. Comment on your findings.

>**Answer:** Following is the code for the estimate of the standard error:

```{r}
get_median_sample <- function(splits){
  rez  <- median(analysis(splits)$medv)
  rez
}

bt_resamples$medians <- map(.x = bt_resamples$splits, 
                          .f = get_median_sample
) 

bt_std.error_medianhat <- bt_resamples %>%
  unnest(medians) %>%
  summarize(
    std.error = sd(medians)
  ) %>%
  pull(std.error)

bt_std.error_medianhat
```

We observe relatively narrow 95% conf. interval.

*(g)* Based on this data set, provide an estimate for the tenth percentile
of `medv` in Boston suburbs. Call this quantity $\hat{\mu}_{0.1}$. (You
can use the `quantile()` function.)

>**Answer:** Following is the code for the estimate:

```{r}
tenthhat <- quantile(Boston$medv, probs = 0.1)
tenthhat
```

*(h)* Use the bootstrap to estimate the standard error of $\hat{\mu}_{0.1}$. Comment
on your findings.

>**Answer:** Following is the code for the estimate of the std. error:

```{r}
get_tenthperc_sample <- function(splits){
  rez  <- quantile(analysis(splits)$medv, probs = 0.1)
  rez
}

bt_resamples$tenth <- map(.x = bt_resamples$splits, 
                          .f = get_tenthperc_sample
) 

bt_std.error_tenthperc <- bt_resamples %>%
  unnest(tenth) %>%
  summarize(
    std.error = sd(tenth)
  ) %>%
  pull(std.error)

bt_std.error_tenthperc
```
